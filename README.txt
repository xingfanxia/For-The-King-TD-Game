- What this program does

    Welcome to our game ForTheKing! This is a PVP game called “For the King” with elements of turn-based games, RPG and tower defense games.
    
- How to Play

    To start the game, run the file WelcomeScreen.java found in source/View. This will take the player to the welcome screen.

    On the welcome screen, players can read the rules of the game by clicking the help button. The rules are also presented here for convenience.
        - Rules: This is a PVP game. Players are divided into two teams, the light and the dark. Each two players from the two teams will be placed at two ends of the same lane on the map and they will fight against each other.
                 To fight, construct buildings in the building phase. Different buildings will automatically spawn different minions with distinctive properties in the fighting phase to fight against the enemy minions. Different buildings, of course, cost different amounts of gold. Gold can be earned by killing enemy minions. Choose the buildings wisely by considering the buildings of your opponent.
                 Each team also has a king that they need to protect. Minions who survive to reach the opponent base on their own lane will be transported to the king lane to protect and fight for the king. The ultimate mission for players on the same team is to cooperate with each other and kill the enemy king.
                 Now go and fight for the king!

    After the player finishes reading the rules, click on the BackToHome button and the player will be taken back to the welcome screen.

    Click on Play to initialize players. Choose the number of players and then enter the names of the players one by one. Remember to choose a color for your player. When you are done, click start to enter the construct building phase for player1.
